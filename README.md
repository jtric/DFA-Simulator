DFA Simulator
==================================================================================================
A Java-based simulator for Deterministic Finite Automata. This simulator reads in .fa files (text-based
descriptors of Finite Automata), determines if they're deterministic or nondeterministic, validates DFAs,
and simulates them.

Simulation involves running multiple input strings from relevant .in files and noting whether the DFA produces
an accept or reject state.

You are welcome to download this code and play around with it for whatever Automata-based reasons you may have.
However, you may NOT use this code as part of any public online projects (personal OR commercial) or academic projects
(e.g., things that receive a grade and academic credit). You may NOT fork, rehost/redistribute, or otherwise include
this project in anything else.

This repository is an archive for posterity, not an active development.

Learning from others' code is recommended. Plagiarising others' code for academic grade points is not.
